# Git Watcher Desktop App - Project Summary

## Overview
Successfully created an Electron desktop application that replicates the functionality of the original `watch_file.py` script with a modern, user-friendly interface.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Folder Selection
- Native folder selection dialog
- Automatic detection of .jsonl files in selected folders
- Clear display of selected folder path

### 2. File Watching
- Real-time monitoring of .jsonl files using Chokidar
- Efficient incremental reading of new file content
- Automatic detection of file changes and rotations

### 3. Session Management
- Automatic parsing of conversation data from .jsonl files
- Session start/end lifecycle management
- API integration with the configured endpoint

### 4. WebSocket Communication
- Real-time WebSocket connection for command execution
- Bidirectional communication with the backend service
- Automatic command execution and output capture

### 5. Git Operations
- Automatic execution of git commands via WebSocket
- Command output streaming to the UI
- Error handling and reporting

### 6. User Interface
- Minimal, clean design with status indicators
- Real-time event streaming display
- Status indicators: Started (orange), Processing (blue, pulsing), Done (green), Error (red)
- Live command output and WebSocket message display

## Technical Architecture

### Main Process (`main.js`)
- Electron main process handling window management
- File watching logic using Chokidar
- WebSocket client for command execution
- IPC communication with renderer process

### Renderer Process (`renderer.js`)
- UI event handling and user interactions
- Real-time display updates
- Status management and logging

### Preload Script (`preload.js`)
- Secure IPC bridge between main and renderer processes
- Context isolation for security

### UI (`index.html`)
- Responsive design with modern styling
- Event stream with syntax highlighting
- Clear status indicators and controls

## Functionality Comparison with Original

| Feature | Original Python Script | Electron App |
|---------|----------------------|--------------|
| File Watching | ✓ Polling-based | ✓ Event-based (Chokidar) |
| JSONL Processing | ✓ Line-by-line parsing | ✓ Incremental parsing |
| Session Management | ✓ API calls | ✓ API calls |
| WebSocket Communication | ✓ asyncio/websockets | ✓ ws library |
| Git Command Execution | ✓ subprocess | ✓ child_process |
| User Interface | ✗ Command line only | ✓ Modern GUI |
| Status Indicators | ✗ Console output | ✓ Visual indicators |
| Event Streaming | ✗ Console logs | ✓ Real-time UI display |

## Files Created

1. **main.js** - Electron main process with core logic
2. **preload.js** - Secure IPC bridge
3. **index.html** - User interface
4. **renderer.js** - UI logic and interactions
5. **package.json** - Project configuration and dependencies
6. **README.md** - Comprehensive documentation
7. **test-logic.js** - Core functionality testing
8. **package-app.js** - Distribution packaging script

## Testing Results

- ✅ All dependencies load correctly
- ✅ JSON parsing works as expected
- ✅ File watching detects changes
- ✅ Folder scanning finds .jsonl files
- ✅ Core logic functions properly
- ✅ Packaging creates distributable version

## Distribution

The app is packaged and ready for distribution with:
- All necessary files included
- Essential dependencies bundled
- Installation instructions provided
- Cross-platform compatibility (Windows, macOS, Linux)

## Usage Instructions

1. Install Node.js and Electron
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies
3. Run `npm start` to launch the application
4. Select a folder containing .jsonl files
5. Click "Start Watching" to begin monitoring
6. View real-time status and event stream

## Configuration

The app is pre-configured to work with:
- API Endpoint: `https://4634e217c2b6.ngrok-free.app`
- WebSocket Endpoint: `wss://4634e217c2b6.ngrok-free.app/ws/execute`

These can be modified in the `main.js` file if needed.

## Success Criteria Met

✅ **Folder Selection**: Native dialog for selecting watch folders
✅ **Minimal UI**: Clean, intuitive interface with essential controls
✅ **Status Indicators**: Visual feedback for Started, Processing, Done states
✅ **Event Streaming**: Real-time display of WebSocket messages and operations
✅ **Backend Replication**: Exact functionality match with original Python script
✅ **Git Automation**: Automatic execution of git commands via WebSocket
✅ **Cross-Platform**: Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux
✅ **Distribution Ready**: Packaged for easy deployment

The Electron desktop app successfully replicates all functionality of the original `watch_file.py` script while providing a modern, user-friendly interface with real-time visual feedback.
